		<h1> <center> Story of a Half Sneakerhead </center> </h1>
		<h3> <center> By <i> Victor Liang Zheng </i>Section:MW8F</center></h3>
		<br/>
		<hr/>
		<p> The term <i><b> sneakerhead </b></i>  is a person who collects, trades, or admires sneakers as a hobby. I started to form a hobby which is to collect sneakers three years ago. It was when I was sophomore in high school, I realize that I'm in love with sneakers and started to pay attention to it. This happens is when one day, one of my classmates wear a <b><i><u>Nike AF-1</u></i></b> into class and start telling the histories of the sneaker he is wearing. It was at that moment, I started to have in contact with the term, <b><i><u> Sneakers. </u></i></b></p>
		<p> The reason that I say I'm a <b>half sneakerhead</b> is that I don't have the ability to obtain every sneaker that I wanted to and it will be my ultimate dream to obtain every sneaker that I love one day. </p>
		<p> These are several famous sneaker brands nowadays: </p>
		<ol type="I">
		<li><b><i>Nike</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Air Jordan</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Adidas</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Converse</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Vans</i></b>
		</ol>
		<p> Few of the must-have sneakers that everyone should obtain: </p>
		<ul>
		<li><b><i>Nike Air Force 1</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Nike Air Jordan 1</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Adidas Stan Smith</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Converse Chuck Taylor 1970s</i></b>
		<li><b><i>Vans Old Skool</i></b>
		</ul>
		<p> There are so many great sneakers that everyone should obtain, those listed are just a few of them. Hope that there will be one day where I can obtain a sneaker without hesitation.</p>
		<p> Below are a few links that I wanted to recommend and wanted people to know about when they step into the field of sneakers:</p>
		<ol type="A">
		<li><b><i><a href= "http://stockx.com "> StockX </a></i></b>. The reason that I recommend this website is because of one of its biggest advantages of <b><i>StockX</i></b> is its real-time market data, letting you know exactly what a product is currently worth, much as traditional stock indexes do. This makes for more intelligent buying and selling instead of random bidding.
		<li><b><i><a href= "https://sneakernews.com"> Sneaker News </a></i></b>. This website gives you basically every information you needed for either a release of specific sneakers and where and how to cop that sneaker. It also provides buying guide  limited sneakers. <b><i>Sneaker News</i></b> is the best source for information about sneakers, highly recommend people to take a look of this website if they wanted to cop specific sneaker.</i></b>
		<li><b><i><a href= "https://yeezysupply.com"> Yeezy Supply </a></i></b>. The Adidas Yeezy line is a footwear/apparel line by <b><i>Kanye West</i></b>. Yeezy is one of the most popular shoes since its first release on 2015 and its price is still high nowadays. I recommend this website is because this is the official site for Yeezy and many Yeezy releases will be done through this website, like the most recent Adidas Yeezy releases which are the <b><i>Yeezy Boost 350 v2 “Triple White”</i></b> , and it was the biggest Yeezy release to date.
